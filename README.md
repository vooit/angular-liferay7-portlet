# Angular 4 Starter Project

This project is a basic tech demo of how one can setup a very basic [Angular 4](https://angular.io) project and use [Webpack 2](https://webpack.github.io) to transpile and bundle everything together for distribution.

The demo application includes:
* [Twitter Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com)
* [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io)
* [ngx-pipes](https://github.com/danrevah/ngx-pipes)

Usage:

npm install 

# 2. serve app using webpack-dev-server
npm start

# 3. build a standalone version for deployment
npm build:prod
```
